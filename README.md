# Digital-Logic-Project-Files
These are the Project Files for my Digital Logic Video Series

# Video 1: Logic Gates:
Showing how to build an OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, BUFFER Gates.

# Video 2: Binary:
I show how to Count in Binary, Read, Convert, And do arithmetic with it.
Then we build an 8-Bit Adder which adds 2 8-Bit numbers together.
Then using 2s Complement I turn the Adder in to an Adder+Subtractor.
Which turn the 2nd number Negative and adds the 2 giving the same output has subtracting.

# Video 3: Memory:
I begin with explain what a Truth Table, its a table that shows the the Output of a Chip with a given Input. Letting you see the Output of a chip before experimenting with it, and helping you to reverse engineer the chip sometimes.
I start by build an Set-Reset Latch which when the Data pin in on the Output of the SR-Latch stays ON. And only resets when the Reset pin is activated.
Then we build a Data Latch that will store the value of the Data Pin, when the Store pin is active.
Next is the Computer's Clock, which keeps everything in sync. Adding this to the Data Latch
is Synchronous witout a clock its Asyncronous.
Then we Make Data Flip-Flops, and go up to a 1-Bit Register.
Then combine those in to a 4-Bit Register which requires a Clock to function.

# Video 4: RAM & ALU:
In the fourth video go into how to build 16-Bytes of RAM or 128 1s and 0s of Memory.
And how to build an Arithmetic and Logic Unit which can do Addition, Subtraction, Incrementation, Decrementation
AND, OR, XOR, and, NOT.
